== Writing Fixture Code

In the following, the supported fixtures are explained.

include::fixtures-decision-tables.adoc[]

include::fixtures-scenarios.adoc[]

=== Special Cases
This section shows some details that are valid for decision tables and scenarios.

==== Expecting Exceptions as Output
Some inputs lead to an `Exception` being thrown.
As a business expert, you can expect this to happen by using the keyword `error` as expected value in the
decision table or scenario.
If an `Exception` is thrown and expected, the test is marked as executed successfully.

==== Reporting the actual result
If you do not really know what to expect in the decision table, you can just leave the field with
the expected value empty and LivingDoc reports the result of the fixture.

This means that error ("error") and an empty value ("") are reserved keywords for LivingDoc and these strings cannot be used as expected strings.
