= ADR 4: Implement JUnit 5 Test Engine

== Context

In LivingDoc Legacy we had multiple plugins which provided execution of documents
for different contexts:

- Eclipse
- IntelliJ
- Maven
- Gradle

Each of which needed to be maintained. Having just one way of executing documents,
which works for all of these contexts, would save us a lot of maintenance work.

With the development of JUnit 5 there is a way of implementing generic _test engines_
which are used by the _JUnit Platform_ to execute all kinds of custom tests. The
platform is integrated in all of the popular IDEs and build tools.

We will implement a JUnit 5 _test engine_ for the execution of LivingDoc documents.
This test engine will be the bridge between the _JUnit Platform_ and LivingDoc.


== Decision

We will implement a JUnit 5 test engine.


== Status

Accepted.


== Consequences

* We'll have to maintain only one integration module.
* We don't need to handle the integration into IDEs or build tools
* We won't provide UIs for the IDEs like we did in LivingDoc Legacy
