= Quick start

This quick start guide covers a use-case including a simple specification file.
Before this can be started, the steps from the Getting Started section of the link:README.adoc[README] must first be performed.

== Test Subject

Assume you have the requirement to write a calculator for Float numbers which should be able to sum, subtract, multiply and divide.

A primitive implementation could look like this:

.Calculator.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
/**
 * A primitive implementation of a calculator, which is our SUT (System under Test) here
 */
 class Calculator {

    fun sum(a: Float, b: Float): Float {
        return a + b
    }

    fun diff(a: Float, b: Float: Float {
        return a - b
    }

    fun multiply(a: Float, b: Float: Float {
        return a * b
    }

    fun divide(a: Float, b: Float): Float {
        return a / b
    }
}
----

See link:livingdoc-tests/src/main/kotlin/org/livingdoc/example/Calculator.kt[Calculator.kt]

== Simple case specification

The fixture code is one part of using LivingDoc, the other part is the specification document with the example data.
This can be in markdown, html or feature (gherkin) files.
In our case we have specified Calculator.md to deliver the TestData for our tests, realised as DecisionTable and Scenario Fixtures.

The DecisionTable example consists of a headline, a description and a table.
The first two columns of the table represent the input values, and the third and fourth the expected value of a calculator action.

.Calculator.md
[source,md]
----
# Calculator

Examples

|  a |  b | a + b = ? | a - b = ? | a * b = ? | a / b = ? |
|----|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|  0 |  0 |  0        |  0        |  0        | NaN       |
|  1 |  0 |  1        |  1        |  0        | Infinity  |
|  0 |  1 |  1        | -1        |  0        |  0        |
|  1 |  1 |  2        |  0        |  1        |  1        |
----

The ScenarioFixture example does not use tables but small sentences instead.

.Calculator.md
[source,md]
----
# Scenario 1

- adding 1 and 2 equals 3
- adding 1 and 4 equals 5
- multiplying 3 and 2 equals 6

== Fixture Code

For the testing, it is needed to implement some fixture code. Like unit test cases the fixtures should be implemented in a separate class as part of a test module.

First we have to decide where we want to get our specification from.
Assume that it should be retrieved from a markdown file from the local file system.
Therefore we create a class and annotate it with `@ExecutableDocument` and specify the location of the markdown specification file:
.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt

[source,kotlin]
----
@ExecutableDocument("local://Calculator.md")
class CalculatorDocumentMd {
----

The ExecutableDocument annotation is used to specify the example/specification data source.

Assume we have a DecisionTable in our markdown specification file. The next step is to write the DecisionTableFixtures.
Each Decision Table Fixture has to be specified in its own class and must be annotated with `@DecisionTableFixtures`.

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@DecisionTableFixture
class CalculatorDecisionTableFixture {
----

The next step is to specify our calculator from above as a System under test (SUT)

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
private lateinit var sut: Calculator
----

Afterwards we need specify the input for our calculator and initialize it.
We do this again with annotations. In this example you can see `@Input` can be used on mutable properties and functions.
In this case we add `@Input` annotations for the two input values of the calculator. We also create an new instance of our calculator for each a table row.

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@Input("a")
private var valueA: Float = 0f
private var valueB: Float = 0f

@BeforeRow
fun beforeRow() {
    sut = Calculator()
}

@Input("b")
fun setValueB(valueB: Float) {
    this.valueB = valueB
}
----

The actual test case is added via a check annotation.
In this case we want to check, if the values from our table is equal to the expected result.

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@Check("a * b = ?")
fun checkMultiply(expectedValue: Float) {
    val result = sut.multiply(valueA, valueB)
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(expectedValue)
}
----

Another possibility instead of a Decision Table is to write a ScenarioFixture.
In this case we have to use the following

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@ScenarioFixture
class CalculatorScenarioFixture {
----

The init of the SUT is analog, but instead of the `@BeforeRow` annotation we use the `@Before` annotation to init the SUT once for each scenario.

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@Before
----

Each step of a scenario is mapped to a function annotated with `@Step` and a matching template.
Templates can contain variables, which can be bound to parameters of the annotated function using `@Binding`.

.CalculatorDocumentMd.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
@Step("adding {a} and {b} equals {c}")
fun add(
    @Binding("a") a: Float,
    @Binding("b") b: Float,
    @Binding("c") c: Float
) {
    val result = sut.sum(a, b)
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(c)
}
----

The completed file can be seen here: link:livingdoc-tests/src/test/kotlin/org/livingdoc/example/CalculatorDocumentMd.kt[CalculatorDocumentMd.kt]

When the fixture from above is used in a Living Doc execution, it will retrieve the data from the markdown file, the test subject will be tested with the fixture methods and the example test data.
