/**
 * Methods annotated with this annotation are always invoked before the first {@link Check} of each row is executed.
 * These methods are generally used to execute test code based on the {@link Input} values and store the results to be
 * evaluated by the {@link Check} methods. This is a purely optional mechanic! Depending on the test case, directly
 * executing that logic inside a {@link Check} method might be the best approach.
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The annotated method must not have any parameters!</li>
 * <li>If multiple methods of a single fixture are annotated the invocation order is non-deterministic!</li>
